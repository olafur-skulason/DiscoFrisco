Description:

Disco is a neighbor discovery protocol. The version implemented here is based on the paper by Prabal Dutta and David Culler, as published in Practical Asynchronous Neighbor Discovery and Rendevous for Mobile Sensing Applications, developed for the TinyOS platform. Testing of the protocol was done using the TelosB platform.

The protocol is developed for the course Wireless Sensor Networks at Aarhus University in the spring of 2018.
